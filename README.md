# Rowing Scripts
Just a bunch of scripts I put together to visualise our race practices and starts. 
I track our sessions with my Garmin VivoActive HR and use R to visualise stroke rate, split (min\500m), and sometimes my own hear rate. Much of our races here come down to the best start possible (bump racing), and so optimising the first 500m is essential.

## Process
1) record with fitness tracker (Garmin Vivoactive HR in my case)
2) convert to csv file (Garmin fitsdk is required to convert fit files to csv files)
3) load csv data with R scripts and visualise

# Todo
- add this to a plotly dashboard 
- automate import and conversion
